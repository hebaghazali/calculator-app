## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/) - This course was a great help to me for building the JavaScript logic of a calculator, and also gave me enough knowledge to implement 3 different color themes. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
